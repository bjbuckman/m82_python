The GALPROP_BB code was used to run the actual cosmic ray models. The code here is the code I used to analyze the output from GALPROP_BB. The output consists of 2D cylindrical maps of emission as a function of energy or frequency (synchrotron & free-free in radio and bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, & pion-decay in gamma rays) and cosmic-ray populations as a function of energy.
